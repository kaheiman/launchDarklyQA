The LaunchDarkly SDK initializes within your application, it works as follows:

1. **Initial Flag Payload**: The SDK pulls down the current feature flag configurations from LaunchDarkly's server upon initialization. This is usually done synchronously to ensure that the flags are available as soon as possible. (
    Default Values in Application Code is a fallback
    When you define a feature flag in LaunchDarkly, you can optionally specify a default value in your application code when calling the SDK to evaluate a flag. This default value is used by the SDK only if:

    - The SDK hasn't been able to fetch the flag's real value from LaunchDarkly yet (e.g., during initialization).
    - The SDK encounters an error (e.g., network issue, flag not found, etc.).
    - The flag doesn't exist in LaunchDarkly.

    be careful of feature flag and migration flag. No need to update the default value if feature flag get updated
)
   
2. **Initial State**: While the SDK is waiting for the feature flag payload from LaunchDarkly, it can serve default values for flags. These default values can be configured in your code, allowing the application to behave predictably until the real flag values are retrieved.

3. **In-Memory Storage**: Once the initial payload is retrieved, the SDK stores this information in **memory**. This allows the application to evaluate and serve feature flag variations **instantly** without making additional network requests for each evaluation.

4. **Asynchronous Updates**: After the initial flag configurations are loaded, the SDK continues to function asynchronously:
   - If you're using **streaming mode**, the SDK will receive real-time updates for any changes to the flags and update the in-memory storage accordingly.
   - In **polling mode**, the SDK will periodically check for changes and update the in-memory storage at the polling interval.

5. **Flag Evaluations**: Whenever a flag is evaluated (i.e., when your application checks whether a feature should be on or off), the SDK evaluates it based on the **in-memory data**. This ensures that flag checks are instantaneous and do not require additional network calls.

6. **Send Flag Evaluation Data Back**: After evaluating a feature flag, the SDK sends data back to LaunchDarkly about how the flag was evaluated. This is used for analytics and auditing purposes (for example, how many users received a particular variation of the flag).

### Clarification:
- **Default Values**: If thereâ€™s a delay in pulling the feature flag data (e.g., network latency), or the flag doesn't exist yet, the SDK can fall back to **default values** specified in your application code. Once the actual flag values are fetched, the SDK updates its in-memory store with the retrieved values and serves the correct flag variations based on that data.
  
In summary, the SDK **does not serve only default values permanently**. The default values are just a fallback mechanism while waiting for the real flag data to be fetched asynchronously. Once the SDK has fetched the real flag data, it serves those values from memory going forward.
